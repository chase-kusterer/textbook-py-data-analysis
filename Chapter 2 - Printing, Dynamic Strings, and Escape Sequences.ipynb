    "### 2.1 The Fundamentals of print() Statements\n",
    "Print statements are one of the most useful and fundamental operations in Python. We rarely want to print the output of every line of code that we write, and will even encounter several programs that do not print anything. The **print()** command helps us to manage what output gets printed, and what output should be suppressed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is printing?\n",
    "To clarify, to <em>print</em> simply means to <em>display</em>. When we call the <strong>print()</strong> function, we are telling Python to display something. When we call <strong>print()</strong> in Jupyter Notebook, by default, Python displays its results directly under the cell containing the <strong>print()</strong> statement.\n",

Using the single-quote wrapper, the string to be printed is cut off at the apostrophe in <em>she's</em>, and then picks up again at the end of the quote. Technically, this **print()** statement contains two strings: 1) <em>\"I told my wife that she</em> (wrapped in single-quotes), and 2) <em>said the husband.')</em> (starting with a double-quote but never ending). The remaining text is not recognized as a string. Although this is clearly not what we had intended, it is important to note that this print statement will fail for three reasons:"

However, notice what happens when we add additional syntax to our code block, as in <em>Code 2.1.2</em>. Ah ha! Now things are different!

In other words, Python outputted the final line of code that it processed.<br><br><strong>Outputting is not the same as printing!</strong> If we created a program consisting just the two lines of code in <em>Code 2.1.2</em>, the program would run behind the scenes and not generate any output.

This is exactly why we have <strong>print()</strong> statements!<br><br><em>Code 2.1.5</em>, contains three separate print statements. Wouldn't it be more efficient to combine these into one print statement? This is possible, as the <strong>print()</strong> statement was designed to handle multiple arguments. For example, in <em>Code 2.1.6</em>, we are saving different parts of our <em>Hello world!</em> statement as objects. When we wrap a <strong>print()</strong> statement around these objects, separating them with a comma, Python returns all of our arguments compiled into one result.<br><br>"

    "Several new things have happened in <em>Code 2.1.6</em>, including the declaration of three objects (part_1, part_2, and part_3). A good way to think of an object in Python is to think of a suitcase, or better yet, a magic suitcase.<br><br>\n",
    "Have you ever flown on an airplane where bringing any luggage other than a carry-on bag was prohibitively expensive (maybe even to the point where the baggage fee was higher than the cost of the actual suitcase you were trying to bring)? Have you, or someone you know, ever tried to avoid any additional baggage fees by filling your carry-on so full that you had to sit on it to get it to close? Have you ever experienced a situation where so many passengers were bringing carry-on bags that there was note enough room in the overhead bins and someone had to put their bag under the plane, thus defeating the purpose of carry-on? If you nodded your head while reading any of these questions, I feel your pain. If we met in real life, I imagine we could have a detailed conversation on how we would change airline luggage policies if we were in power.<br><br>\n",
    "However, what if instead of focusing on the airlines, we focused on the luggage itself? What if we sat down together and invented a suitcase that would adapt in size based on the amount of things you put into it? What if this suitcase could also magically disappear when you put it in the overhead bin, and would reappear only when you needed it? We would probably need to label our luggage very well so that it doesn't get confused with someone else's, but imagine how much more pleasant air travel would be if such magic suitcases existed.<br><br><strong>Objects in Python can be thought of as magic suitcases.</strong> They are only as large as they need to be, can store anything that needs to be stored, and exist when they are told to exist. They need to be labeled very clearly, as no two objects can have the same name, and object names should be intuitive enough so that we know what's being stored inside them. There are a few rules to naming objects in Python which can be found in [Section 2.3 of the official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html): object names can contain <em>\"the uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z, the underscore _ and, except for the first character, the digits 0 through 9.\"</em>"

    "If you look closely at the result in <em>Code 2.3.1</em>, it is clear that a space has been added between <em>world</em> and the exclamation point. This is because the <strong>print()</strong> statement has an optional argument called <strong>sep</strong>, which stands for separator and has a default value of a single space. If you were unaware of this optional argument, please reference the <strong>help()</strong> documentation for the <strong>print()</strong> statement. If you have no idea how to do this, or are unsure what an optional argument is, please reference the content in [Chapter 1: Before Learning Anything Else, Learn This](https://github.com/chase-kusterer/Python-for-Business-Analytics/).<br><br>\n",

There is no virtually limit to the way we can separate our <strong>print()</strong> statements. We can also override the default value for the <strong>end</strong> argument, which by default is set to start a new line after each individual <strong>print()</strong> statement. An example of this has been done in <em>Code 2.3.3</em>. In this code, the two print statements end with a <em><tab\\></em> and an arrow ( --> ), respectively.

    "### 2.4 Escape Sequences\n",
    "By now, you have been working with several characters in Python that have special meanings ( <em>'</em> , <em>#</em> , <em>\"</em> , etc.). Such characters are appropriately named <strong>special characters</strong>. Oftentimes, we want to drop the special meaning of a character and use it as text. At other times, we want to take a character that Python normally interprets are text and activate its special meaning. If you're confused, have no fear. There is one simple tool to understand and everything else will come with practice. Essentially, Python has a built in character that we can think of as a light switch: it's job is to turn on or turn off the meaning of special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backslash ( \\ ), the Light Switch for Special Characters\n",
    "In <em>Code 2.1.4</em>, we initiated an escape sequence using a backslash to turn off the special meaning of the apostrophe character ( <em>'</em> ). By placing a backslash immediately before any such character, Python will ignore its special meaning and interpret it as text. Likewise, the default interpretation of some characters is text, and placing a backslash immediately before such characters activates a special meaning. <em>Table 2.2</em> displays some of the most commonly used escape sequences and special meanings for our current level of programming.

It is similar to the chaining technique used in [Section 1.1 of Chapter 1 - Setting Up for Success](https://github.com/chase-kusterer/Python-for-Business-Analytics/), and is extremely common in Python programming for business analytics. We will learn more about this in later chapters.\n",

    "#### Line 7 - Printing the Result\n",
    "Dynamic strings can be created in one of two ways. In <em>Code 2.5.3</em>, the letter 'f' that is placed immediately before the string in the <em>print()</em> statement tells Python that this code is meant to be dynamic. Objects to be referenced in dynamic strings need to be placed between curly brackets {}. Any time Python sees a set of curly brackets in a dynamic string, it treats whatever is inside as its own line of code. The second method for creating dynamic strings is the .format method, which can be found in [Section 6.1.2 of the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html).\n",

    "<strong>Side Note:</strong> If you're trying to print curly brackets in a dynamic string, remember that you can use the backslash to escape special characters.\n"

    "#### The Advantage of Dynamic Strings\n",
    "Dynamic strings allow for more than just the inclusion of objects. They also allow programmers to:\n",
    "* create less objects, thus enhancing the speed of our working environment\n",
    "* better control the formatting of strings\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Section 1.2 of Chapter 1 - Setting Up for Success](https://github.com/chase-kusterer/Python-for-Business-Analytics/) discussed how our working environment gets slower as more objects and packages get loaded. Therefore, it is beneficial to minimize the amount of objects we create. <em>Code 2.5.4</em> is an adaptation of our program in which no objects are created. Instead, code for the <em>time</em> object has been embedded withing the dynamic string. These minor enhancements can add up to a massive difference!<br><br>\n",
