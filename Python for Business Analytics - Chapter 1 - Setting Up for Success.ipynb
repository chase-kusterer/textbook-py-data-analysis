    "Python was designed to be a simple programming language. In fact, in 1999, Guido van Rossum, the founder of the Python language, sent a funding proposal to DARPA for his *Computer Programming for Everybody* initative, where he posited the following question:<br><br>\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><strong>\n",
    "    \"What would the world look like if users could program their own computer?\"\n",

    "This proposal, which was submitted by van Rossum and the *Python in Education Special Interest Group* [can be found here](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/everybody/). It is an interesting read and makes some very good points. However, even though Python may be easy to learn, **it is important to learn how to learn Python, and that is the purpose of this chapter.** At times, you will get stuck, and you need to know what to do. There will also be many times when your code won't run properly, even when you've spent hours trying to debug it. This is very frustrating, and it is something all coders experience from time to time. The good news is that as long as you are not one of the world's most advanced Python coders, someone has already experienced and solved your problem. More importantly, it is very likely that a solution to your problem has been generously shared to the open source community. All you need to know is where to find it. Not knowing can be devastating to your morale. To exemplify this, the following story is from one of my former students, which took place while conducting an analysis for the course: Machine Learning.<br><br>\n",

Learning analytics, especially coding, was a very interesting experience, although sometimes I would lose confidence, questioning whether this was the right field for me. A great example of this is the Game of Thrones Character Prediction analysis project.<br>\n",
    "        \n",
    "We had a dataset based on the book series, which contained around 2000 characters and several features describing each character. It was probably the most stressful project of my life. Throughout this project, sleeping 6 hours a night was a luxury. I spent countless hours working on the dataset: engineering new features, testing out different machine learning algorithms, and trying not to question my life choices too deeply. On the note of life choices, coincidentally, the campus café was looking to hire a new manager and they asked me if I would like the position. I have to be very sincere, after the lack of sleep, the stress of hours of trying to debug my code to no avail, and the process of trying to build an algorithm that predicts reasonably well, the option of giving up and living a more chill life sounded very appealing.<br>\n",

    "#### Line 1 - Built-in functions\n",
    "Python comes with a set of default, or **built-in functions**. These are also referred to as **primitives**, and are functions that are so important, they are available without the need to import additional packages (for an example of a package import, see *Code 1.1.3* where we import the package *pandas*). At the time of this writing, the most recent version of Python (*version 3.7.3*) has 69 built-in functions, which can be found in [the Python documentation on Built-In Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Python also comes with a series of other built-ins. For example, *built-in types*. According [to the Python documentation on Built-In Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html), principal built-in types include numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions. Think of built-ins as the primary numbers of Python: every function can be broken down into these built-ins. Also, keep in mind that Python was designed to be used for a wide variety of programming tasks, and what is commonly used for business analytics is just one small subset. To avoid information overload, this book will primarily focus on the built-ins, functions, methods, and packages that are most relevant to our purposes. If you're not sure what a function, method, or package is, don't worry. We will go into these details in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Line 3 - The function being looked up\n",
    "As the heading implies, this line specifies what you have looked up. When we called help on the *print()* function in *Code 1.1.2*, this didn't seem to add a lot of value. However, this information becomes extremely useful in other situations, such as in *Code 1.1.3* where *help()* is being called on a user-created object. For now, don't focus on what *Code 1.1.2* is trying to do. Instead, focus on the *help()* function in the last line."

      "      - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\n",
      "      - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n",

Other times you may find solutions to your question, but they are too complicated for your current coding ability. Every now and then, you will be more confused than when you started your search. This is normal. Keep in mind that Stack Overflow was designed so that coders could ask questions to coders, regardless of their programming level.

Think about this. Search engines were designed in a way that is friendly to humans. The search functions in Stack Overflow was designed in a way that it is friendly to programmers, which is a subset of humans with a sophisticated understanding of programming jargon. When this happens, click on the Stack Overflow page and take note of how the question was phrased. This is a good way to improve your ability to find the information you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge for the Reader:** If you are serious about learning Python, register with Stack Overflow and start writing answers to other people's questions. This will intensify your learning speed. Stack Overflow also assists new contributors in that they let other coders know that they are new to the platform. This means that other coders will realize you are trying your best, and in most cases they will be more than willing to give you feedback."

    "Notice how in *Code 1.4.3* we replaced the longer hashtag comments with triple-quote strings. This is a way to provide comments to humans on multiple lines of code in a more readable way. Technically speaking, Python will recognize these as lines of code and then try to run them. However, since there is no *print()* wrapper around these statements and they are not assigned to objects, Python has no use for them and immediately forgets that they exist. In other words, since Python has not been instructed to do anything with the triple quote statements, it ignores them. Finally, notice also that we added parentheses around each of the triple quotes. This is a good practice as it helps to organize our code and to prevent unwanted errors.<br><br>\n",
    "*Note:* There may be a time when someone reviewing your code tells you that using stand-alone strings (i.e. strings that aren't part of an object or a *print()* statement) to make comments is a bad practice. There is some rationale to this, as since Python runs stand-alone strings as code, it takes a tiny bit longer for your code to process. In fields like algorithmic trading, \"a tiny bit longer\" can mean missed opportunities, and thus such comments should be avoided. In business analytics, however, the purpose of most analyses is to gain insights and make recommendations. This takes a thorough and thoughtful exploration of the data, as well as constant communication with stakeholders to truly understand the problem you are trying to solve. In this sense, **your goal is to communicate as clearly as possible.** If this is best done by using stand-alone strings, use them.<br><br>\n",
