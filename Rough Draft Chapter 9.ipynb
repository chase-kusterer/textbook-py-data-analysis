    "Python is an extraordinarily popular language for many reasons, one of them being that it has a strong open-source community. In general, <a href=\"https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source\">open source</a> projects are community-driven, publicly available, and free of charge. More often than not, our analytical endeavors will rely on open source packages such as <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/index.html\">numpy</a>, <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\">pandas</a>, <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html\">scikit-learn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html\">statsmodels</a>, <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/contents.html\">matplotlib</a>, <a href=\"https://seaborn.pydata.org/\">seaborn</a>, and many others depending on our task at hand. Each of these packages contains functions that were designed for a specific purpose, and most contain optional or variable arguments to allow a certain level of flexibility and customization in their use.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Before diving into the aforementioned packages, it is important to understand the inner workings of functions. This will not only help in utilizing publicly-available resources to their fullest extent, but will also help in identifying when a developer may have cut corners. Every so often, a package is released that is difficult to learn due to poor documentation, which is an indication that the package's functions may be unstable or only work in a very limited context. Understanding how to write, document, test, and exception handle user-defined functions will greatly increase your ability to benefit from functions available in the open source community.\n",

    "Functions follow a similar framework to conditional statements and loops in that their first line starts with a designated syntax and ends with a semicolon (<em> : </em>). Additionally, anything inside a function's body must be indented. Unlike other coding structures covered thus far, functions need to be defined before they can be used. In other words, you need to load a function before you are able to use it. You can think of this like working with packages in that they must be imported before their methods become available.\n",

    "#### The Limited World of a Function\n",
    "It is important to understand why <strong>return</strong> statements are required to get something back from a function. To get there, think of your working environment as the entire planet on which all of your code lives. We will call this the <strong>global environment</strong>. Also, think of declaring an object as creating an living being on your planet, and this being is free to interact with other objects in the global environment. If another object is declared with the same name, it will cause conflict and the former object will be overwritten.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Now, think of the body of a function as its own island where its inhabitants have been secluded for so many generations that they are completely oblivious to anything that exists elsewhere. This is good because these objects have no way to adversely affect the global environment (i.e. overwriting objects). We will call this island the function's environment. Oftentimes, we need something from the function's environment to interact with the global environment, and as the master of both environments, we have the ability to make this happen. In other words, at times we need to something from the island to <strong>return</strong> to the global environment. The syntax to accomplish this is, not surprisingly, named <strong>return</strong>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A <strong>return</strong> statement has been added to <em>Code 9.2.2</em>, where the <em>square()</em> function is returning the results of a calculation. More commonly, such results are first stored within an object in the body of a function and the object is returned. This is occurring in <em>Code 9.2.3</em>, where the calculation results have been stored in the object <em>val</em>, which is referenced in the <strong>return</strong> statement. Both codes give the same result.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Note that even though <em>val</em> was returned in <em>Code 9.2.3</em>, it is not actually available in the global environment. This is Python's way of protecting the function's users from accidentally overwriting object names. For example, if the global environment already contained an object named <em>val</em>, it would be overwritten, which may adversely effect the user. On the same token, any object in the global environment that shares the same name as an object in a function's environment will not be overwritten if the function is called, even contains a <strong>return</strong> statement. There is one exception to this rule, which will be covered later in this chapter. The results of <em>Code 9.2.4</em> confirm that <em>val</em> has not been defined globally.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "#### Storing Function Output\n",
    "A common method for storing the returned output of a function is to declare it as an object. The type of the declared object depends on what was returned from the function. In <em>Code 9.2.5</em>, since the <em>square()</em> function returned an integer, the object <em>' y '</em> is of this type.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Also note that once Python executes a <strong>return</strong> statement, it leaves the body of the function, even if another <strong>return</strong> statement is on the next line. However, a <strong>return</strong> statement can reference more than one thing (separated by commas). By default, if more than one thing is returned from a function, as in <em>Code 9.2.6</em>, the stored object will be a <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences\">tuple</a>. <strong>Tuples</strong> are very similar to lists, but are represented with curved brackets and are immutable (they cannot be changed). <strong>Tuples</strong> are very important in functional programming, but are beyond the scope of our current coding abilities. For now, it is important to understand that indexing a <strong>tuple</strong> is no different than indexing a list.\n",

In other words, their purpose is to help users understand what something does and how it should be used. They are a key component of many coding structures in Python, including functions, classes, modules, and packages, although we will only be discussing them in terms of functions in this chapter.

    "## 9.5 Functions with Variable Arguments\n",
    "Recall from  <a href=\"https://github.com/chase-kusterer/Python-for-Business-Analytics\">Chapter 1: Learn This Before Learning Else</a> that <em>*args</em> and <em>**kwargs</em> allow for arguments of varying length. In other words, these syntaxes are very useful when there is need to allow flexibility in the amount of inputs a user can specify. A good example of such a need is a shopping list. To keep things simple, let's assume that the requirements for our <em>shopping_list</em> function are to take items as arguments and then print them one-by-one. Also, common knowledge implies that different users will have shopping lists of different lengths. Therefore, it would be very challenging if users were forced to make their list of a certain length. For example, if our function was designed as follows:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "def shopping_list(item_1, item_2, item_3):\n",
    "    print(f\"\"\"\n",

    "    * {item_1}\n",
    "    * {item_2}\n",
    "    * {item_3}\n",
    "    \"\"\")\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "users would be required to have shopping lists that consist of exactly three items. Otherwise, the function will throw an error. A remedy to allow users more flexibility would be to make all of the arguments optional, setting their default values to <em>None</em>. Using this approach, users would be able to input as many items as they like, up to the amount of optional arguments that exist in the function. Additionally, the number of optional arguments could be increased to allow for longer lists. Although this approach solves the need for more flexibility, the function's body is unnecessarily long and inefficient:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "def shopping_list(item_1=None, item_2=None, item_3=None):\n",
    "    print(\"Shopping List:\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    item_list = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if item_1 != None:\n",
    "        item_list.append(item_1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if item_2 != None:\n",
    "        item_list.append(item_2)\n",
    "        \n",

    "As with conditional statements, it is possible to write functions within functions. Before discussing further, however, it is important to reemphasize that variables in a function's body are in a different environment than variables (i.e. objects) outside of a function's body. This is a concept known as <strong>variable scope</strong>. When you create and open a new Jupyter Notebook or a new Python script, you are in the <strong>global environment</strong>, and all variable created here are globally scoped. This means that these variables are available in every part of your script (including the body of a function)."

    "Oftentimes, once an exception is thrown, Python will terminate whatever operations it is running as it does not know how to move forward. This also gives programmers an opportunity to fix their code. However, our learnings in <a href=\"https://github.com/chase-kusterer/Python-for-Business-Analytics\">Chapter 3: User Input and Variable Types</a> have taught us that errors can also be caused by user input. To help manage this, Python includes two useful syntaxes: <strong>try</strong> and <strong>except</strong>. As their names suggest, <strong>try</strong> permits a program to <em>try</em> to do something, and <strong>except</strong> is what to do in the event that the program throws an <em>exception</em> after trying. Essentially, the <strong>try</strong>/<strong>except</strong> structure is like a conditional statement designed to help manage errors."

    "#### Customizing <em>try</em>/<em>except</em> based on Exception Types\n",
    "Generally, it is a good practice to write an exception clause for each error that a user may reasonably encounter. Such a practice allows for different exceptions to lead to different actions. For example, the user-defined function in <em>Code 9.8.3</em> is likely to encounter either a <em>TypeError</em> (user did not overwrite the default value for the argument <em>apples</em>), or a <em>ValueError</em> (user did not input an integer value for <em>apples</em>). As such, two <strong>except</strong> clauses have been coded, each leading to a different action in order to remedy its respective error. Once the function receives an appropriate value for <em>apples</em>, the <strong>try</strong> clause runs successfully and breaks out of the <em>while True</em> loop.\n",

    "Let's apply <strong>try</strong>/<strong>except</strong> to <em>Code 8.4.3</em>, which has been replicated in <em>Code 9.8.4</em>. As you may recall, this code was designed to calculate how many seasons it took for Michael Jordan to score 25,000 points. Our original approach threw exceptions when encountering the strings in the points per season data (index 1 in each sublist). Thus, one of our first steps was to clean the data so that points per season only contained integers. This was a good approach, but it is limited. To illustrate, let's assume an overnight change was made to our data source and all data within had been converted to strings. In such a case, the data cleaning process conducted in <a href=\"https://github.com/chase-kusterer/Python-for-Business-Analytics\">Chapter 8: while Loops and Making Assumptions</a> would result in no data. A more sounds approach would be to <strong>try</strong> to convert each string into an integer and tally successful attempts accordingly. This would also allow for the possibility of calculating how many seasons were skipped due to Jordan not playing. <em>Code 9.8.4</em> has been left open for you to:\n",
    "* convert the values for points per season into an integer\n",
    "* handle exceptions when a value is inappropriate for the aforementioned type conversion\n",
    "* add new functionality such that the code outputs the number of seasons where Jordan did not play leading up to surpassing the point limit\n",
