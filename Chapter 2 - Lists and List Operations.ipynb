    "\n",
    "Having learned the basics of indexes in the previous chapter, we are ready to understand the value of declaring lists. For our purposes:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><h3>\n",
    "    Lists are a way to better organize our information.\n",
    "<a class=\"tocSkip\"></h3></div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal with lists is to store more than one item in the same place. You can think of this as declaring one object that holds many things. Conceptually, lists are the simplest of Python's four built-in data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets), and are something that you must be comfortable with before conducting data analysis in Python. They are used very frequently, even at the entry levels of analysis, and your time spent understanding them will pay dividends on your ability to grasp more advanced concepts in Python.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### A special note for Excel users:\n",
    "If you're used to working with Excel sheets, also known as flat files, please note that these exist in Python as well. We call these DataFrames, and they are housed in the <strong>pandas</strong> package. You may be wondering:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><em>\"Why do I need to learn about lists if I can use a data structure that I'm more familiar with?\"</em></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This mentality held me back when I was first learning to code. I was used to my data being structured in a spreadsheet format and expected it to always be this way. It also didn't help that in most cases, data science competitions provided data in some sort of spreadsheet format, or something that could easily be converted into one. I did not fully understand the value of other data structures until I started to work on real projects. In the real world, data comes in <em>many</em> formats, and in today's world of analytics, you will be expected to do much more than work with flat files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key lesson to keep in mind is that <strong>coding involves a different type of thinking than working with software such as Excel</strong>. You will not regret the time invested in learning how to work with different data structures.<br><br>\n",

    "<em>Code 5.2.1</em> and <em>5.2.2</em> are virually the same. The only difference is that in the latter, we added <strong>square brackets</strong> <em>[ ]</em> around the item being stored. The square brackets tell Python that we are creating a list.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We can even declare a list with nothing inside of it. The idea of declaring an empty list may seem bizarre, but it is actually done quite often. We will explain the rationale for this when we discuss <strong>for loops</strong> in a later chapter.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Notice that the output of the print statement in *Code 5.2.2* also has square brackets. This is to inform you that *my_list* is a list and not a scalar (single) variable.\n",

    "A <strong>class</strong> is a template to create objects. When we created <em>my_variable</em>, we created an object that stores an integer. Integers are very common in Python, thus they have a template (i.e. a class).

More information on classes can be found in [the Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/classes.html).<br><br>\n",

To exemplify this, see <em>Code 5.2.4</em>. Even though both objects contain the value 5, we do not get the same result when applying simple numerical operands such as multiplication.

As this is our first time working with **.reverse()**, it is best to take a conservative approach and create a new object for the reversed-version of our list (*Code 2.6.5*).<br><br>\n",

    "### The *Wrong* Way to Copy Lists\n",
    "Before we learn how to do this the right way, let's see what happens when we do this the *wrong* way. In *Code 2.6.5*, we have created a new object (*rev_my_list*) with the intention of using it to make our reversal while preserving the integrity of our original list (*my_list*).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, everything appears to be working properly. Let's perform our reversal in *Code 2.6.6*. As can be observed, the reversals worked and our list got extended, but with an unintended consequence: Every change to *rev_my_list* also changed *my_list*. It may seem strange, but this is the way objects work in Python. When we ran *rev_my_list = my_list* in *Code 2.6.5*, created two objects that share the same address. In other words, the lists are two different names for the same object. Changing either list will affect both lists. This is apparent in *Code 2.6.7*.\n",

    "At the time of this writing, Python 3 has 11 built-in methods for lists, which can be found in [the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html). Masting the five presented in this chapter, as well as indexing and slicing, are enough to provide a good foundation to move forward into more advanced concepts."
