    "The order of operations in Python is the same as in standard mathematics, which can be denoted with the acronym PEMDAS (parentheses, expontentiation, multiplication/division; addition/subtraction). However, Python has a deeper set of operands (comparison operands). Many methods in Python take an input, make a calculation, and then do something based in its result. Therefore, our acronym needs to be extended to PEMDAS+. In other words, Python will first handle all PEMDAS computations before running any comparisons. Below is a table of comparison operands:\n",

    "<h3>4.5 Basic Randoms and Ranges</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, programs require a way to generate a random number or element. There are many packages in Python to help solve such a challenge, and in this chapter we will focus on those existing in the <strong>random</strong> package. As its name implies, <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/random\">the random package</a> contains several methods to generate random variables.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>4.5.1 The Need for Different Types of Generators</h4>\n",
    "The field of random number generation is extremely interesting. This is partly because computers are not very good at doing things that they are not programmed to do. In other words, computers are not meant to be random. If this were <em>not</em> the case, tasks such as debugging would be incredibly difficult. This being said, computer scientists have developed methods to address this challenge. Essentially, random numbers come in two forms: pseudo-random and true random. According to <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/183051/htg-explains-how-computers-generate-random-numbers/\">howtogeek.com</a>:\n",
    "<br><br><div align=\"center\"><em>\n",
    "    Computers can generate truly random numbers by observing some outside data,<br>\n",
    "    like mouse movements or fan noise, which is not predictable, and creating data from it.<br>This is known as entropy. Other times, they generate “pseudorandom” numbers by using<br>\n",
    "    an algorithm so the results appear random, even though they aren’t.\n",
    "</em><a class=\"tocSkip\"></a></div><br>\n",
    "When we ask a program to pick a random number, we are asking it to follow a sequence (i.e. an algorithm), resulting in a number being generated that only <em>appears</em> to be random. In fact, the computer is not being random at all, but instead is following its programming instructions as expected. For many programming challenges (including those covered in this chapter), pseudo-random number generation is a good solution as it is easy to implement and control. However, in fields such as security encryption, pseudo-random can be dangerous for the very reason that it can be predictable.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Random number generation also interesting because randomness makes it difficult to replicate results. If a researcher was attempting to confirm a study by a colleague, uncontrolled randomness would complicate this process. To hurdle this obstacle, most random number generators come with an optional <strong>seed</strong> argument. Essentially, a seed is a starting point in pseudo-random number generation. In other words, you can conceptualize a seed in random number generation as you would any other seed: they are the starting point for where something starts growing. For example, if we wanted to plant roses in our garden, we would bury rose seeds in the spots where we want our roses to grow. As another example, let's assume we wanted to select one number from the following sequence of ten numbers:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>If we do not set a seed (i.e. a starting point), each number would have a 10% chance of being selected. However, if we set a seed to start at, say, the fifth number, that number has a 100% chance of being selected. This becomes more useful in cases where we would like to select more than one number from a sequence. Also, as you might imagine, random number sequences are quite a bit more complex than the one above. Therefore, it is difficult to intuitively determine the results from using a given random seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>4.5.2 Random Number Generation and the Philosophy of Analytics</h4>\n",
    "Take a moment to ponder the following question:\n",
    "<br><br><div align=\"center\"><em><strong>\n",
    "    What is random?</strong>\n",
    "</em><a class=\"tocSkip\"></a></div><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Try to think of a random number between 1 and 100. How did you make your selection? If asked the same question again, do you feel you would have chosen a different number? Do you feel that all numbers between 1 and 100 had an equal chance of selection, or do you feel that your choice may have been biased? If you felt your selection was biased, select another number. Did you compensate for this bias? If so, do you feel your selection is more random, or more predictable?<br><br>\n",
    "Thought experiments such as this help shed light on an interesting notion: it may be completely infeasible to generate a truly random number. We all have biases, and as analysts it is our responsibility to acknowledge and minimize their effects on our endeavors. Each of our ideas should be supported by data, and our results should be replicable. Also, it is unlikely that the results of our analysis will fully reflect the phenomenon we wish to study without error. In fact, a common philosophy in statistics that the true value of something as fundamental as a population mean will never truly be known, and can only be estimated within a certain degree of confidence. This implies that we also need to keep an open mind when attaining results that go against our intuition (i.e. one of our biases). It is unlikely that we will ever generate truly random numbers, just as it is unlikely that we will ever truly attain results that are completely error-free. This perspective will become incredibly valuable when we venture into the chapters dedicated to data analysis.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h4>4.5.3 Ranges</h4>\n",
    "In order to generate a random number in Python, we first need to specify a range of values in which to draw a random number from. In other words, we need to tell Python which values it is allowed to use. In Python, a <strong>range</strong> is a sequence of index values, and in simple terms, <strong>index</strong> means position. For example, each number in our previous sequence has its own position. This helps Python understand where each number is located, and allows us to do many powerful things (covered in <strong>Chapter 5 - Lists and List Operations</strong>). By default, indexes start at zero.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "Index:    0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |\n",
    "Value:    0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  | 13  | 21  | 34  |\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<strong>Note:</strong> You may be wondering why sequences in Python start at zero and not one. This is because Python was engineered using concepts from linear algebra. If you are unfamiliar with linear algebra, think of the x- y- coordinate plane, where the origin is at point (0, 0). As our sequence above is one dimensional, its origin is point zero. Thus, Python uses this number as the first index value.\n",

    "As stated earlier, we shall be utilizing the <strong>random</strong> package. This package is filled with a delightful set of methods that allow us to add randomness to our code. We shall start with importing <strong>random</strong> and using its <strong>randint()</strong> method. As always when using a new method for the first time, it is important to <strong>read the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint\">Python documentation</a></strong>.

    "Notice two things in the <strong>help()</strong> documentation: the square brackets <em>[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</em> and that the range includes both endpoints. These two aspects of the <strong>help()</strong> file are redundant. In mathematics, square brackets imply that an end point is inclusive. Their counterpart, round brackets <em>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</em>, imply the opposite. Little details such as whether or not a range includes endpoints are extremely important.

    "    Lists are a way to better organize our information.\n",
    "<a class=\"tocSkip\"></a></h3></div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal with lists is to store more than one item in the same place. You can think of this as declaring one object that holds many things. Conceptually, lists are the simplest of Python's four built-in data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets), and are something that you must be comfortable with before conducting data analysis in Python. They are used very frequently, and your time spent understanding them will pay dividends on your ability to grasp more advanced concepts in Python.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<h4>A special note for Excel users:</h4>\n",
    "If you're used to working with Excel sheets, also known as flat files, please note that these exist in Python as well. We call these DataFrames, and they are housed in the <strong>pandas</strong> package. You may be wondering:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><em>\"Why do I need to learn about lists if I can use a data structure that I'm more familiar with?\"</em></div>\n",

    "This mentality held me back when I was first learning to code. I was used to my data being structured in a spreadsheet format and expected it to always be this way. It also didn't help that in most cases, data science competitions provided data in some sort of spreadsheet format, or something that could easily be converted into one. I did not fully understand the value of other data structures until I started to work on real projects. In the real world, data comes in <em>many</em> formats, and in today's world of analytics, you will be expected to do much more than work with flat files.\n",

    "Up to this point, we have covered several fundamental coding principles. Now, we are ready to dive into more advanced structures, starting with techniques to conditionally control a code's output. In short, we are ready to discuss conditional statements. A <strong>conditional statement</strong> (also known as a conditional) is a coding syntax that runs if a given condition is met. Conditional statements are very common in the real world. Take, for example, the following statement:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "If it's raining, the baseball game will be canceled.\n",
    "Otherwise, the game will take place as scheduled.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As generally in the real world, Python conditional statements start with the word <em>if</em>. The syntax for the alternative statement (<em>'otherwise'</em> in the example above), is <em>else</em>. In the case of the statement above, if it is not raining, the condition to cancel the game is not met and the thus is disregarded. This is better exemplified in the following expansion of our baseball example:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "If it's raining, the baseball game will be canceled and we will email all of the people\n",
    "that bought tickets. We also have to issue refunds, and will do so by directly\n",
    "crediting people's credit cards. Since some people paid in cash, we will provide them\n",
    "with a cash voucher in the email that can be redeemed within the next 90 days. Also,\n",
    "since some people may have traveled a long distance to attend the game, we need to make\n",
    "sure to remind them that our Terms and Conditions state that we are not responsible for reimbursing travel expenses. Finally, we should inform our call center that they may\n",
    "receive a high call volume given the situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the game will take place as scheduled.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Compared to the first example, the second takes longer to read and process. It would be incredibly inefficient if we were required to read and process all instructions for every conceivable situation every time there was a baseball game, especially if the conditions for each instruction were not met. Python feels the same way, and takes a similar, pragmatic approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>A Note to Excel Users</h4>\n",
    "The syntax covered in the chapter is very similar to the <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/if-function-69aed7c9-4e8a-4755-a9bc-aa8bbff73be2\">IF function in Excel</a>:\n",
