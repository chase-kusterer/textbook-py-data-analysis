    "Conditional statements such as those starting with <strong>if</strong> are an excellent starting point for controlling the flow of a code. Such statements have been appropriately termed <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html\">control flow tools</a>. This chapter will expand on such tools with a syntax known as <strong>for loops</strong>. <strong>Loops</strong> are a powerful coding structure that allow programmers to <strong>iterate</strong>. In other words, loops allow us to run a code over several items stored in an object without the need to implicitly write code for each run. If this isn't making sense just yet, think of loops as a faster/more advanced alternative to copy/pasting. We will solidify our understanding as we move forward through this chapter.\n",

    "Loops come in two forms: <strong>for loops</strong> and <strong>while loops</strong>. The former is used to iterate over an iterator (i.e. strings, lists, arrays, columns of data, etc.). Without more detailed instruction, <strong>for loops</strong> will run until they have completely iterated over every item in an object. For example, if we have five items in a list, a basic <strong>for loop</strong> will iterate over all five items one at a time. As with the conditional statements covered in <strong>Chapter 6: Conditional Statements and Controlling Input</strong>, loops operate on a boolean pretense (True/False). For example, if you run a <strong>for loop</strong> on a list, the loop will run until it is <em>False</em> that there are still items in the list to iterate over. Just like with conditional statements, if a condition is <em>False</em>, Python will move on to the next line of code formatted at Column 0. An example of a <strong>for loop</strong> is displayed in <em>Code 7.1.1</em>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A basic <strong>while loop</strong> can be thought of as an extension of a conditional statement. As long as the given condition is true, a <strong>while loop</strong> will continue to iterate.

    "Essentially, the <strong>for loop</strong> in <em>Code 7.7.1</em> starts by operating on the first item of <em>lst</em>, printing its value. When it has completed this task, it moves on to the second item and performs the same operation. This continues until the contents of the loop have run on all elements in <em>lst</em>. Afterwards, the <strong>for loop</strong> realizes that <em>lst</em> no longer has any items to iterate over and stops running (i.e. it runs until it is <em>False</em> that there are still items in the list to iterate over).\n",

    "The anatomy of a <strong>for loop</strong> (<em>Figure 7.1</em>) is very similar to the anatomy of a conditional statement. The first line of a loop starts with a syntax identifying which type of loop is being coded (in this case a <strong>for loop</strong>), and ends with a semicolon ( : ).

In <em>Code 7.2.2</em>, <em>random_name</em> has been used instead of <em>element</em>. More formal coders like to use the letter <em>i</em>. The key is to make sure that you do not use an object name that already exists in your code as this may cause conflict. Once an iteration object has been named, it will exist in your Python environment and will store the value of the last iteration of it's respective loop. In the case of the loop in <em>Code 7.2.2</em>, the last iteration from <em>lst</em> was the letter <em>'e'</em>. This can be observed from printing the contents of <em>random_name</em>, as in <em>Code 7.2.3</em>. Again, <strong>it makes no difference what you name your iteration object</strong>. This being stated, it is in your best interest to name it something that helps you remember what your loop is supposed to do. <em>Code 7.2.4</em> is an open coding block designed for you to be able experience the fact that it does not matter what the iteration object has been named.\n",

    "<strong>Hard coding</strong> is the process of writing code that contains static syntax (i.e. using <em>hard</em> numbers instead of objects). It may not make a huge difference in the code  snippet above, but it can create several frustrations in larger codes. For example, let's imagine we were using the imputed value of price (<em> price = 100 </em>) in more than one place in our code. If it was later decided that missing prices should be imputed at a value of 200, we would need to be very careful to ensure that we update every <em>price = 100</em> throughout our script. Additionally, this change may take a long time to code, test, and debug.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Generally, a good practice is to <strong>soft code</strong> whenever possible. <strong>Soft coding</strong> is the process of writing code utilizing objects instead of static syntax. This allows programmers to declare an object in one place and reuse its value(s) throughout their code. If a requirement came in to change an object's value (i.e. the imputation value for price), this change would only need to be made in one place. Below is a modified code snippet that utilizes soft coding.\n",

    "In addition to the fundamentals of <strong>while loops</strong>, this chapter will also cover some syntax that is also useful in other coding structures, namely for loops and user-defined functions (covered in the next chapter). For example, in many situations a programmer needs to <strong>break</strong> out of the body of a loop before an iteration has finished. At other times, it may be necessary to skip over an item in an iterable and <strong>continue</strong> the loop by iterating on the next item. As you may have guessed, the syntaxes that enable such functionality are <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops\">break</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops\">continue</a>.

As an example, notice the difference between <em>Codes 8.0.1</em> and <em>8.0.2</em>.

    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, <strong>while loops</strong> can be utilized to accomplish tasks such as taking a list of all the students in a cohort and breaking them into teams of four. To exemplify this, let's assume our cohort had a total of eight students, as in <em>Code 8.1.1</em>. Let's also assume that teams need to be random and that no student is allowed to be on more than one team. In order to accomplish our task, we need to develop a code that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* randomly selects a student and puts them on a team\n",
    "* removes the student from the selection pool so that they do not end up on more than one team (sampling without replacement)\n",
    "* fills each team to exactly four members\n",
    "* keeps iterating until every student has been placed on a team\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by importing the random package so that we can utilize the method <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-sequences\">choice</a> in our code. This method is designed to randomly choose one element from a population. Given our requirements, a drawback to using this method is that it samples with replacement, meaning there is a chance that a student will be selected more than once."

   "source": [
    "Unfortunately, there is no optional argument in <strong>random.choice</strong> that enables sampling without replacement. However, the problem of selecting a student more than once can be avoided through a clever design of our code. What if, after a student is selected in an iteration of our loop, they were removed from the <em>students</em> list? This way, there would be no chance of the same student being selected in the next iteration of the loop, as the student would no longer be available for selection. This can be achieved by applying the <strong>.remove()</strong> method on <em>students</em>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Also note that at first, the condition of the <strong>while loop</strong> may seem unclear. Essentially, this condition is telling Python to keep looping as long as there is something to iterate over in <em>students</em>. In fact, the syntax:\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "Finally, each time <em>Code 8.1.1</em> is run, different teams are created. This does not violate any of the requirements for our task, but it makes it difficult to replicate our results.

Given our goal, it seems unfair to consider these seasons in our calculation, and thus they should be removed. In this, we are making an assumption, and <strong>all assumptions should be documented.</strong> Another analyst could approach the same problem and feel it is more appropriate to include seasons where Jordan did not play in the NBA. The rationale for such a decision could be argued from a number of viewpoints, such as:\n",

    "* This calculation should be made as the total number of seasons between Jordan's first and the one in which he surpassed 25,000 points.\n",

    "The value of an analysis stretches far beyond the sciences, and in many cases, it is far more of an art.

Without documentation, it is incredibly difficult to understand an analyst's thought process. Moreover, it becomes challenging to trust the findings and actionable insights that resulted from such work. Assumptions need to be documented, whether embedded within scripts, in a document or project management tool, or even in a notebook that you keep next to you while you are working. Although this takes time up front, it will save you countless hours in the long run, especially when working with other analysts or reviewing an analysis that you conducted several months ago.\n",

    "<h4>Developing our Solution</h4>\n",
    "In order to calculate how many seasons it took for Jordan to score more than 25,000 points, we first need to develop a method to iterate over total points in each list of <em>jordan_stats_2</em>. This can be accomplished with the use of a for loop, as covered in <strong>Chapter 7 - for Loops and Basic Data Manipulation</strong>. Our goal is to stop iteration after accumulating a certain number of total points, and for this we have multiple options. More specifically, we may choose to fit out the body of the for loop with either a conditional statement or a <strong>while loop</strong>, as both could solve this task. Since conditional statements were already covered in <strong>Chapter 6 - Conditional Statements and Controlling Input</strong>, we will build a solution using this method first. <em>Code 8.4.2</em> has been left open for this task. Make sure to:\n",

    "* stop iteration after accumulating at least 25,000 points\n",
    "* use a conditional statement inside the body of a for loop (don't use a <strong>while loop</strong>)\n",
    "* avoid soft coding wherever feasible\n",

    "The bodies of <em>Codes 8.4.2</em> and <em>8.4.3</em> look very similar.

The solution utilizing the <strong>while loop</strong>, however, uses less lines of code. Additionally, this solution appears to be easier to extend if there was a change in our requirements. For example, let's assume that it was decided that points should only be accumulated in seasons where Jordan led the league in scoring.

Thus, each season played within these years has two scoring leaders. If our code was designed to allow only one scoring leader per season, it may throw an error. We may also run into a situation where a player was traded and thus has two records for a given season. This may prove to be a challenge when calculating how many seasons the player took to attain a certain number of points.

    "<h4>The Limited World of a Function</h4>\n",
    "It is important to understand why <strong>return</strong> statements are required to get something back from a function. To get there, think of your working environment as the entire planet on which all of your code lives. We will call this the <strong>global environment</strong>. Also, think of declaring an object as creating an living being on your planet, and this being is free to interact with other objects in the global environment. If another object is declared with the same name, it will cause conflict and the former object will be overwritten.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Now, think of the body of a function as its own island where its inhabitants have been secluded for so many generations that they are completely oblivious to anything that exists elsewhere. This is good because these objects have no way to adversely affect the global environment (i.e. overwriting objects). We will call this island the function's environment. Oftentimes, we need something from the function's environment to interact with the global environment, and as the master of both environments, we have the ability to make this happen. In other words, at times we need something from the island to <strong>return</strong> to the global environment, and the syntax to accomplish this is, not surprisingly, named <strong>return</strong>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A <strong>return</strong> statement has been added to <em>Code 9.2.2</em>, where the <em>square()</em> function is returning the results of a calculation. More commonly, such results are first stored within an object in the body of a function and the object is returned. This is occurring in <em>Code 9.2.3</em>, where the calculation results have been stored in the object <em>val</em>, which is referenced in the <strong>return</strong> statement. Both codes give the same result.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Note that even though <em>val</em> was returned in <em>Code 9.2.3</em>, it is not actually available as an object in the global environment. This is Python's way of protecting the function's users from accidentally overwriting object names. For example, if the global environment already contained an object named <em>val</em>, Python protects this object from being overwritten. On the same token, any object in the global environment that shares the same name as an object in a function's environment will not be overwritten when the function is called, even if it contains a <strong>return</strong> statement. There is one exception to this rule, which will be covered later in this chapter. The results of <em>Code 9.2.4</em> confirm that <em>val</em> has not been defined globally.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<h4>Storing Function Output</h4>\n",
    "A common method for storing the returned output of a function is to declare it as an object in the global environment. The type of the declared object depends on what was returned from the function. In <em>Code 9.2.5</em>, since the <em>square()</em> function returned an integer, the object <em>' y '</em> is of this type.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Also note that once Python executes a <strong>return</strong> statement, it leaves the body of the function, even if another <strong>return</strong> statement is on the next line. However, a <strong>return</strong> statement can reference more than one thing (separated by commas). By default, a function will return a <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences\">tuple</a> if more than one object referenced in a <strong>return</strong> statement (<em>Code 9.2.6</em>). <strong>Tuples</strong> are very similar to lists, but are represented with curved brackets and are immutable (they cannot be changed). <strong>Tuples</strong> are very important in functional programming, but are beyond the scope of our current coding needs. For now, it is important to understand that indexing a <strong>tuple</strong> is no different than indexing a list.\n",

However, there is no reason to restrict yourself from being thorough if you feel it will benefit users. At the time of this writing, the <strong>docstring</strong> for the method <em>pandas.DataFrame</em> is 72 lines long.

    "<h2>9.5 Functions with Variable Arguments</h2>\n",
    "Recall from  <strong>Chapter 1: Learn This Before Learning Else</strong> that <em>*args</em> and <em>**kwargs</em> allow for arguments of varying length. In other words, these syntaxes are very useful when there is need to allow flexibility in the amount of inputs a user can specify. A good example of such a need is a shopping list. To keep things simple, let's assume that the requirements for our <em>shopping_list</em> function are to take items as arguments and then print them one-by-one. Also, common knowledge implies that different users will have shopping lists of different lengths. Therefore, it would be very challenging if users were forced to make their list of a certain length. For example, if our function was designed as follows:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",

    "def shopping_list(item_1, item_2, item_3):\n",

    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "users would be required to have shopping lists that consist of exactly three items. Otherwise, the function will throw an error. A remedy to allow users more flexibility would be to make all of the arguments optional, setting their default values to <em>None</em>. Using this approach, users would be able to input as many items as they like, up to the amount of optional arguments that exist in the function. Additionally, the number of optional arguments could be increased to allow for longer lists. Although this approach solves the need for more flexibility, the function's body becomes unnecessarily long and inefficient:\n",

    "As with conditional statements, functions can be written within functions. Before discussing further, however, it is important to reemphasize that variables in a function's body are in a different environment than variables (i.e. objects) outside of a function's body. This is a concept known as <strong>variable scope</strong>. The default environment outside of a function's body is known as the <strong>global environment</strong>. This is where you will be if you open a blank Jupyter Notebook or a new Python script. All variables created in the <strong>global environment</strong> are globally scoped. This means that these variables are available in every part of your script (including the body of a function)."

    "Let's apply <strong>try</strong>/<strong>except</strong> to <em>Code 8.4.3</em>, which has been replicated in <em>Code 9.8.4</em>. As you may recall, this code was designed to calculate how many seasons it took for Michael Jordan to score 25,000 points. Our original approach threw exceptions when encountering the strings in the points per season data (index 1 in each sublist). Thus, one of our first steps was to clean the data so that points per season only contained integers. This was a good approach, but it is limited. To illustrate, let's assume an overnight change was made to our data source and all data within had been converted to strings. In such a case, the data cleaning process conducted in <strong>Chapter 8: while Loops and Making Assumptions</strong> would result in all data being removed due to its type. A more sound approach would be to <strong>try</strong> to convert each string into an integer and tally successful attempts accordingly. This would also allow for the possibility of calculating how many seasons were skipped due to Jordan not playing. <em>Code 9.8.4</em> has been left open for you to:\n",

    "User-defined functions are a powerful tool that allow programmers to blueprint code so that it can be used over and over again. Defining a function is similar to writing a conditional statement or a loop in that the first line starts with a designated syntax and ends with a semicolon. Also, the body of a function is indented. Arguments can be specified when defining a function, and can be mandatory (no default value), optional (contains default value), or variable (varies in length). All functions should contain docstrings, regardless of how simple they may be. Docstrings should explain what a function is intended to do, list and explain parameters, and give usage examples.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A variable's scope can have unexpected consequences on other objects. Nested functions require one to pay particular attention to the scope of each variable, which can be managed with the use of <strong>return</strong> statements and scoping syntax such as <strong>global</strong> and <strong>nonlocal</strong>. Scoping syntax should be used with extreme caution as it may adversely affect a user's code. Also, function names should be unique as to not unintentionally overwrite an existing function.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Finally, comprehending how to write, document, test, and exception handle user-defined functions will greatly increase your ability to benefit from functions available in the open source community. When researching packages available in the open-source community, the quality of a package's documentation can indicate whether or not the package is stable and/or will work as intended. When encountering a package that is not documented well, it may be wise to search for an alternative tool.\n",
