This is one of <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html\">Python's built-in data structures</a> (and it is native to many other programming languages as well). As you may recall, compared to declaring several stand-alone objects, <strong>lists are a way to better organize our information</strong>. As we move forward, we will explore more specialized storage objects that are critical for several analytically-related tasks.\n",

The former is often used to represent a set of unique elements, and the latter allows us to create an association between two values (i.e. two variables). If these are difficult to conceptualize, have no fear! It is our hope that by the end of this chapter you will be well-acquainted with both structures and develop an intuition for their usage. As with the content in previous chapters, the concepts of this chapter will be reinforced as you move forward throughout this book.\n",
