    "To complicate matters further (and to have a great reason to introduce set operations!), your friend Jacob has been secretly planning a surprise party for your birthday. Two interesting facts about Jacob: (1) He has an enormous amount of friends, and (2) He likes to invite people to parties that he thinks will become friends. Additionally, he was not aware of the party we were planning, and now two lists of party guests exist. Once this was discovered, it was suggested to combine the lists (remember - sets!). We could simply combine the lists and remove duplicates by converting the result into a set (<em>Code XYZ</em>). However, this would hinder our ability to address some interesting questions about the gathered data. For example:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Which people are on both guest lists?</strong><br>\n",
    "In other words, which of our friends are also friends with Jacob? There are many practical reasons for asking such a question. For example, if you and Jacob got into a huge fight, who would be caught in the crossfire? Sets in Python rely on the method <strong>intersection()</strong> to address such a challenge.\n",

    "\n",
    "<strong>Who is only on our list? Who is only on Jacob's list?</strong><br>\n",
    "There is a high chance that many people at the party will not know each other, especially those appearing on only one of the lists. If a guest only appears on one of the lists, perhaps we can accommodate them better by introducing them to someone that only appears on the other list (in fact, this is how Chase's friend Andrew met his wife Justine). In such situations, we can utilize the <strong>difference()</strong> method.\n",

For now, we can use the <strong>symmetric_difference()</strong> method to address this question, which will result in one set of all of the people that appeared on only one of the guest lists (not both).
